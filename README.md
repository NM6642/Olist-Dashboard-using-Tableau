CONTEXT
Olist is the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces that connects small
businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract.
Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them
directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners.
After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill
that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due,
the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the
purchase experience and write down some comments.

This project showcases a dynamic and interactive dashboard created with Tableau for visualizing Olist's business metrics. Gain insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) related to sales, customer satisfaction, and product performance.
